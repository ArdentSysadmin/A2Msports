<div class="accordion" id="section7"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right"></i>Team Leagues<span></span></div>
<div class="acc-content" style="padding:10px">
	<p style="margin-top:30px"><b>What are Team Leagues and how do they work? </b></p>
	<p>Team Leagues @ A2M Sports are for a team of 3 or higher number of players play against a team with similar # of players. It’s just a regular tournament, but the Draws or Brackets will be done at a Team Level (compared to an individual level in a regular tournament). Your Team will be the winner or 2nd place etc.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>What are Lines in a Team?</b></p>
	<p>Lines are individual matches within a team. If a League Consists of two Singles and three Doubles matches, then, we play two singles lines and three doubles lines. Generally, Line1 (for both singles and doubles) is for Top Level Players in the team. Line2 is for the next level players, Line3 is for next lower level etc.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>How many Players or Lines are in a Team League?</b></p>
	<p>We support anywhere from 1 to 5 Singles and/ or Doubles Lines in each league. Tournament Admin can define the number of lines for his/her league depending on their League.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>Who can form or create a team?</b></p>
	<p>Anyone that wants to lead a group of players and be responsible to manage their entries in and out of the team and is willing to enter scores could form a Team. Usually, Teams represent your Club, School, Academy or your neighborhood. Person that creates the team will automatically become a Team Captain. However, you can always make other players as Team Captain.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>How do I find a Team or join a team?</b></p>
	<p>Once you login to our site, under your name (on Top Right Corner), you will see My Teams page. On My Teams page, you will see a list of Nearby Teams that may be of interest to you. You can join any of those team(s) by sending a Join Request to the Team Captain. Your Team Captain will accept or Deny your request.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>How do I withdraw from a team?</b></p>
	<p>On My Teams page, you will see an option to Withdraw. You just have to click that button!</p></br>
	
	<p><b>How do I register for a Team League?</b></p>
	<p>If you are the team captain, you register your team and yourself for the league. If you are just a player, your Team Captain will add you to the team and you will be automatically registered to the league. If you don’t want to be a Team Captain and just want to play in the league, you need to join a team first. You can do this on your Teams Page by sending a Join Request to the Team Captain.</p></br>
	
	<p><b>What are Team Captain’s tasks/ responsibilities?</b></p>
	<p>Team Captains are responsible to manage their team online and on the court while playing. They can add or remove players from participating in a league or tournament. They are responsible to schedule matches by coordinating with the other Team Captains and enter the scores for their team (if they win the match). They can also organize the social events for the team, though we don’t mandate it:).</p></br>
	
	<p><b>Who enters the Score for the matches? And, How?</b></p>
	<p>Team Captains will have to print a Scorecard for each match. Once the match is played, both captains will enter the scores on the scorecard and sign each other's copy. When they get  chance, generally a winning team captain will enter the score online by clicking Add Score on the tournament page.</p></br>
								
	<p><b>What is the maximum Team Size?</b></p>
	<p>Right now, the team size is limited to 15. However, if there is a specific need to increase it, you can contact us..</p></br>
	
	<p><b>Can I create a team league with different size of teams? Or, can I customize my team league?</b></p>
	<p>Yes. You can create League with any number of players. Your league may have one Singles and one Doubles Lines (3 players), or, up to 10 singles and 5 doubles lines (15 players) or, anywhere in between. Once you create a league, all teams will have a minimum # of players to support each line..</p></br>
	
	<p><b>Do you have any restrictions on players playing at different levels?</b></p>
	<p>In a single match (one team vs the other team), the same player can NOT play in multiple lines. This is the only restriction from our application. There may be other restrictions that your Tournament Director may impose for a specific league. .</p></br>
