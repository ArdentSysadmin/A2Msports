  The program provides an opportunity for Sreenidhi International School students in middle and high school to receive intensive professional coaching and equitable opportunities to participate at high level in various tournaments within India and beyond.
 
We encourage all students to participate in sports or a physical activity with the theory that physical exertion contributes to a healthy lifestyle and complements academic work. As Sreenidhians we believe that sports play a pivotal role in developing balanced students, hence, we place a strong focus on our sports programming, encouraging all students to participate in the team sports we offer.
