	  Playing Sports should be a fun and rewarding experience for all players. Character building lessons such as hard work, discipline, sportsmanship, and handling adversity are regularly on display. Parents of junior players should also enjoy the time spent with their children and watching them develop not just into better players, but into good citizens. Verbal abuse directed at any players, tournament referees, officials, and even the parents is not acceptable. These incidents adversely impact the players' and parents' tournament experience and create a negative and distressing atmosphere for all participants, parents and officials. Such abusive and improper conduct shall not be tolerated. In response to the actions of a few, we have instituted this alert to remind parents and players that abuse of players, referees, or officials by a parent, relative, coach or other person associated with a player and any such abuse may result in the issuance of directives for that person to leave the tournament area and/or the imposition of point penalties and other sanctions authorized by applicable regulations. Abusive behavior in any form shall not be tolerated. Tournament officials and referees will report all instances of such misconduct, and the consequences of such misconduct will be fully enforced. <br /><br />
